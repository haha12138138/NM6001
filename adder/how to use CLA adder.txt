CLA module contains 4 files.
CLA_adder.v is the top level module

CLA_bit_PG and CLA_sum is able to set the width to match the input
CLA_carry_base currently only supports 2bit CLA. but can configure to 4 bit or higher with ease

connection tips:
1.	CLA_carrt_base is organized in a tree structure.
	how to feed carry into corresponding module is a trick.
	cin is fed into the leftest module in every level.

	index the module on each level from 0~end
	suppose using  2-bit CLA blocks
	#0 <-cin
	#1 <-level one(#(floor(1/2)))
	#2 <-level two(#(floor(1/4)))
	#3 <-level one(#(floor(3/2)))
	#4 <-level three(#(floor(4/8)))

2.  the carry_in of the sum module is connected to group_PG level 0
